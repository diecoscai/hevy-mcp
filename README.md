# @diecoscai/hevy-mcp

Model Context Protocol server for the [Hevy](https://www.hevyapp.com/) fitness API. Manage workouts, routines, exercises, and body measurements from any MCP-compatible client — Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, and anything else that speaks MCP over stdio.

## Overview

This MCP server exposes the public [Hevy API](https://api.hevyapp.com/docs) (`api.hevyapp.com/v1`) as 22 strongly-typed tools. LLM agents can list workouts, create routines, look up exercise templates, track body measurements, and follow a delta-sync feed — all without bespoke glue code on the client.

Design goals:

- **Safe by default.** Write operations return a `{ dry_run: true, would_send: { ... } }` preview unless `HEVY_MCP_ALLOW_WRITES=1` is set. The Hevy API has no `DELETE` on any resource, so accidental writes are permanent; dry-run is the brake.
- **Validated at the edge.** Every tool input is checked with [Zod](https://zod.dev/) before a single byte crosses the network. Oversized titles, unknown fields, out-of-range page sizes, and invalid enums fail fast with [SEP-1303](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/seps/1303-input-validation-errors-as-tool-execution-errors.md)-shaped errors the model can self-correct.
- **Zero extra setup.** Authentication is a single environment variable — `HEVY_API_KEY`. No wizards, no config files; just paste the snippet for your client.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20 or later** (`node --version`).
- A **Hevy Pro subscription** — the public API is a Pro feature.
- A Hevy API key from <https://hevy.com/settings?developer>.

## Quick setup

1. Grab your API key at <https://hevy.com/settings?developer> (requires Hevy Pro).
2. Paste the snippet for your MCP client from [Configuration](#configuration) below, substituting your key into the `HEVY_API_KEY` entry.
3. Restart the client. The 22 Hevy tools appear in the tools panel.

> **Note on bare invocation.** Running `npx @diecoscai/hevy-mcp` with no arguments starts a stdio MCP server and blocks, waiting for an MCP client to connect over its stdin/stdout. You don't run it in a terminal yourself — your MCP client spawns it. Use `npx @diecoscai/hevy-mcp --help` or `--version` if you want a non-blocking invocation.

> **Write tools are dry-run by default.** The first time you ask the server to create or update anything (a workout, a routine, a body measurement) you'll see a preview payload, not a real change. Set `HEVY_MCP_ALLOW_WRITES=1` in the same `env` block to execute writes — see [Safety](#safety--dry-run-writes).

## Run from source

While the npm package is being published, you can run the server directly from this repository. This is a regular user path, not a contributor path — contributors should use [Development](#development) below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diecoscai/hevy-mcp.git
cd hevy-mcp
npm ci
npm run build
```

Then point your MCP client at the built entry instead of `npx @diecoscai/hevy-mcp`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hevy": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/hevy-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "HEVY_API_KEY": "PASTE_YOUR_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `env` block (including `HEVY_MCP_ALLOW_WRITES`) works identically to the npx snippets below.

## Configuration

Each MCP client spawns the server as a stdio subprocess with `HEVY_API_KEY` in its `env` block.

### Claude Desktop

Config path:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` *(Anthropic does not ship an official Linux build of Claude Desktop as of 2026; the path applies only to unofficial community builds.)*

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hevy": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@diecoscai/hevy-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "HEVY_API_KEY": "PASTE_YOUR_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Add `"HEVY_MCP_ALLOW_WRITES": "1"` to the `env` block to enable write tools.

### Claude Code CLI

```bash
claude mcp add hevy --env HEVY_API_KEY=PASTE_YOUR_KEY_HERE -- npx -y @diecoscai/hevy-mcp
```

To enable writes, append `--env HEVY_MCP_ALLOW_WRITES=1`.

### Cursor

Config path: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`. Same shape as Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hevy": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@diecoscai/hevy-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "HEVY_API_KEY": "PASTE_YOUR_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code (native MCP support, 1.102+)

Create `.vscode/mcp.json` at the root of your workspace (or put the same shape under a user-level MCP config if your VS Code build supports one):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "hevy": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@diecoscai/hevy-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "HEVY_API_KEY": "PASTE_YOUR_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you use a third-party MCP extension that expects a different shape, check its docs — VS Code's native MCP integration landed in 1.102.

See [`docs/configuration.md`](./docs/configuration.md) for troubleshooting and client-specific notes, and [`docs/examples.md`](./docs/examples.md) for end-to-end flows you can run with a connected MCP client.

## Safety — dry-run writes

Every `POST` and `PUT` tool handler checks `HEVY_MCP_ALLOW_WRITES` at call time:

- Unset (default) — the tool returns a preview instead of making the HTTP call:

  ```json
  {
    "dry_run": true,
    "would_send": {
      "method": "POST",
      "path": "/v1/routine_folders",
      "body": { "routine_folder": { "title": "Push days" } }
    },
    "hint": "set HEVY_MCP_ALLOW_WRITES=1 to execute"
  }
  ```

- Set to `1` — the tool performs the real request.

The Hevy API has **no `DELETE` endpoint** on any resource. A bad write cannot be rolled back from the client — it will persist on your account until you manually fix it in the Hevy app. Dry-run is the first line of defence; explicit opt-in for writes is the second.

## Tool reference (summary)

| `hevy_get_body_measurement` | Fetch the record for a single `YYYY-MM-DD`. |
| `hevy_create_body_measurement` | Create a new record (write — dry-run default). `409` if the date already exists. |
| `hevy_update_body_measurement` | Replace the record for a date — any field not sent is set to `NULL` (write — dry-run default). |

## Environment variables

| Name | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HEVY_API_KEY` | required | Hevy Pro API key (UUID v4). Typically passed through the `env` block of your MCP client config. |
| `HEVY_MCP_ALLOW_WRITES` | optional | Set to `1` to enable real `POST` / `PUT` calls. Any other value (including unset) keeps dry-run on. |
| `HEVY_MCP_DISABLE_CACHE` | optional | Set to `1` to disable the in-memory exercise-template cache (see below). |
| `HEVY_MCP_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | optional | Cache TTL in seconds. Default `3600`. Ignored when the cache is disabled. |

## Exercise-template cache

`hevy_list_exercise_templates` and `hevy_get_exercise_template` read through a
per-process in-memory cache (Map with per-entry TTL, default 1 hour). The
template catalog is large and near-static within a session, so repeated
resolution — e.g. looking up an id while building a routine — costs one HTTP
round-trip instead of many.

`hevy_create_exercise_template` invalidates the list portion of the cache on a
successful write; singleton template entries are left alone (they can't be
made stale by creating a different custom template). The cache is never
persisted across processes.

Disable the cache entirely with `HEVY_MCP_DISABLE_CACHE=1`, or shorten / lengthen
its lifetime with `HEVY_MCP_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`.

## Webhooks — intentionally not exposed

Hevy's public API (`api.hevyapp.com/v1/*`) does **not** document webhook
subscriptions; the relevant endpoints live on the private web-session API
(`/webhook-subscription`, `/subscribe_to_webhook`) which uses a different
auth scheme (refresh-token bearer, not the `api-key` header this server
uses). Exposing tools for them would either (a) ship handlers that throw
"endpoint not available" to every user, or (b) force users to hand over a
web session token just to register a URL.

If you need incremental sync, use `hevy_get_workout_events` with a `since`
timestamp — it covers both `updated` and `deleted` workouts and is the only
mechanism the public API offers for change detection.

If Hevy publishes webhooks in the public OpenAPI spec, subscription tools
will land here with the same dry-run gate as the other writes.

## Development

For contributors working on the server itself. If you only want to run the server locally against your own Hevy account, use [Run from source](#run-from-source) instead.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diecoscai/hevy-mcp.git
cd hevy-mcp
npm ci
npm run build
npm test
```

Useful scripts:

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | `tsc --watch` for the source. |
| `npm run lint` | Biome lint across `src/` + `tests/`. |
| `npm run format` | Biome auto-format. |
| `npm run check` | Biome combined lint + format check. |
| `npm run coverage` | Vitest with V8 coverage. |
| `npm run smoke` | End-to-end: `npm ci && build && test && lint` + stdio probe + language gate. |
| `npm run inspect` | Launches the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) against the built server. |

Adding a tool:

1. Add a Zod schema in `src/validate.ts` (`.strict()` on every object).
2. Add the tool spec (name, description, JSON Schema `inputSchema`) to the `TOOLS` array in `src/index.ts`.
3. Add a `case` in the dispatch switch; always call `validateInput(name, rawArgs)` before touching the network; wrap writes with `guardWrite`.
4. Extend tests under `tests/` (schema + negative probes at minimum).
5. Update the table in this README.

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more.

## Security

- API keys live in your MCP client's config file (same threat model as any other key you'd paste there). The server never reads or writes a config file of its own.
- Writes are dry-run by default; rotating a leaked key in the Hevy app and pasting the new one into your client config takes under a minute.
- The server only ever calls documented `/v1/*` endpoints — no private API traffic, no telemetry, no third-party fan-out.

See [`docs/security.md`](./docs/security.md) for the full threat model.
